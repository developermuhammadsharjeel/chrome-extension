🚀 Chrome Extensions by Sharjeel
This repository is a collection of Chrome Extensions I build — sometimes experimental and fun, sometimes polished and useful. The goal is to learn, experiment, and share!

📂 What’s Inside?
🧪 Experimental Extensions – Small ideas, quick hacks, or random fun concepts.
⚡ Practical Extensions – More refined tools that can actually make browsing easier.
🎯 Learning Projects – Extensions created to explore new APIs, features, or just to sharpen skills.

Each extension will live in its own folder with its own README and instructions on how to install/run it.
