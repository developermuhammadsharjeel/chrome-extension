Privacy Policy
Privacy Blur Screen
Effective date: 2025-09-07

Summary
This extension's primary purpose is to let users blur sensitive or private information on webpages. It does not collect, sell, or transmit personal information to any server.

What information we collect
Local settings only: We store user preferences (e.g., blur radius, overlay positions, whether overlays persist) locally in the browser using Chrome's storage APIs. This data remains on the user's device/browser.
No server collection: The extension does not upload or send these settings, page content, or personal data to any external servers.
Contact data: If you email us, we may store your email address and message to respond; this is optional and only used for support.
Permissions & why they are needed
activeTab — to allow users to select the current tab and apply blur overlays to that page.
Host permissions — to run the overlay on pages where the user chooses to blur content.
scripting — to inject and remove blur overlays dynamically on user-requested pages.
storage — to save user preferences locally.
Third parties
We do not use third-party analytics, tracking, or remote code. If any remote resources or third-party libraries are added in future releases, they will be disclosed here.

Data security
Since data is stored locally in the browser, it is subject to the user's device/browser security. We encourage you to use a secure device and browser profile.
Changes to this policy
We may update this policy from time to time. The Effective date above will change when we make material updates.
